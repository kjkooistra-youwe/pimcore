# Upgrading Pimcore from Version 11.x to Version 12

## Tasks to Do Prior the Update

### WYSIWYG-Editor
#### Enable Quill (recommended)
Please check the bundle [readme](https://github.com/pimcore/quill-bundle/blob/1.x/README.md) for installation instructions.
To migrate from TinyMCE to Quill please check the following [link](https://github.com/pimcore/quill-bundle/blob/1.x/doc/01_Migration_to_Quill.md)

#### Enable TinyMCE (deprecated)
If TinyMCE is still needed for your project, you can still use it, but it has been moved into [PimcoreTinymceBundle](https://github.com/pimcore/tinymce-bundle/blob/1.x/README.md). Check the bundle readme for installation instructions.
There will be no (security) updates for it.
